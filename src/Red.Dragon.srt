- But nobody else did.

All I'm sayin' is,
that was very good work.

323
00:27:12,443 --> 00:27:15,173
No, good work would be seeing it
all the way through...

Don't do it.

Just tell me what's on your mind.

I'm saying maybe we've got
a resource we should look into.

has proven most disappointing.

357

were you able, perhaps,
to reconstruct his fantasies?

00:48:25,915 --> 00:48:28,850
I have those documents
you requested me...

00:49:00,049 --> 00:49:01,414
Yeah, we should have.

646
00:49:01,484 --> 00:49:04,214
We have some books
of Blake's paintings, too.

647
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:06,820
- Want to see them?
- Yeah. Thanks.

00:49:10,627 --> 00:49:13,653
Hi. This is Bob Greer at Blaine
and Edwards Publishing.

651
00:49:13,763 --> 00:49:16,994
Dr. Bloom asked me to send
The Psychiatrist and the Law...

652
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:18,124
to Will Graham.

653
00:49:18,234 --> 00:49:20,725
His assistant was
supposed to give me...

654
00:49:20,803 --> 00:49:23,795
the address and phone number,
but, darn it, she never did.

Linda will be in on Monday.

I have to catch FedEx
in about five minutes.

657
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:31,069
I hate to bother Dr. Bloom
about it...

658
00:49:31,147 --> 00:49:32,978
because he told Linda to send it...

659
00:49:33,082 --> 00:49:35,141
and I don't want
to get her into trouble.

660
00:49:35,251 --> 00:49:38,015
It's right there in the Rolodex,
or whatever.

I'm really not supposed to.

I've come for the package of infrared.

680
00:51:18,888 --> 00:51:21,914
Right. Put your back
against the door and come...

681
00:51:22,225 --> 00:51:25,092
forward three steps till
you feel tile under your feet.

682
00:51:25,194 --> 00:51:27,526
And there's a stool just on the left.

683
00:51:29,699 --> 00:51:33,260
Same Mr. D who's head
of Tech Services, am I right?

00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:35,965
I'm Reba McClane.

685
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:39,938
Just a second more
and I will get you some light.

686
00:51:42,745 --> 00:51:44,906
REBA: Okay, here we go.

687
00:51:49,485 --> 00:51:51,919
So, what do you need the IR for?

688
00:51:53,089 --> 00:51:54,784
It's for the zoo.

689
00:51:54,957 --> 00:51:57,721
They want to photograph
the nocturnal animals.

690
00:51:57,794 --> 00:52:02,231
That's great. I love animals.
I got to warn you, though.

691
00:52:02,498 --> 00:52:07,094
This stuff is pretty sensitive.
It can be mean to handle.

692
00:52:09,739 --> 00:52:12,674
But I guess
I don't need to tell you that.

693
00:52:20,683 --> 00:52:24,244
Hey, Reba. Oh, Mr. D. Whoa!

694
00:52:24,954 --> 00:52:27,422
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

695
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:28,650
No, Ralph.

696
00:52:28,991 --> 00:52:31,118
It's starting to spritz outside.

697
00:52:31,194 --> 00:52:32,252
I'll give you a lift home?

698
00:52:32,328 --> 00:52:33,955
You ride a motorcycle.

699
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:36,260
How's that gonna help me
with the rain?

700
00:52:36,332 --> 00:52:38,994
I thought maybe
we'd stop off someplace...

701
00:52:39,135 --> 00:52:41,126
have ourselves a little sundowner.

702
00:52:41,204 --> 00:52:44,037
- I've already got a ride.
- It's cool.

703
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:47,976
That's cool. No problemo.

704
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,885
If there's anything I hate worse
than pity, it's fake pity.

705
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:04,391
Especially from a walking
hard-on like Ralph Mandy.

706
00:53:05,461 --> 00:53:08,658
- Sorry.
- I have no pity.

707
00:53:42,932 --> 00:53:44,422
Ride with me!

708
00:53:45,334 --> 00:53:48,201
Thanks, but I take the bus
all the time.

709
00:53:50,172 --> 00:53:53,266
Mandy is a fool. Ride with me...

710
00:53:55,811 --> 00:53:57,472
for my pleasure.

711
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:14,361
You want to come in?
I'll fix us a drink.

712
00:54:20,736 --> 00:54:24,069
- Maybe another time.
- I will come in.

713
00:54:32,315 --> 00:54:34,340
When is the zoo project?

714
00:54:35,017 --> 00:54:39,010
- Maybe next week. They'll call.
- I love zoos.

715
00:54:40,823 --> 00:54:45,157
In fact one of my earliest
memories is seeing a cougar...

716
00:54:45,728 --> 00:54:47,662
when I was about five.

717
00:54:47,763 --> 00:54:50,823
I didn't lose my sight
till I was seven. Diphtheria.

718
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:53,198
Could you hand me that knife?

719
00:55:10,086 --> 00:55:14,523
I've always tried to hang on
to what that cougar looked like.

720
00:55:15,524 --> 00:55:19,460
But by now, to tell the truth,
what I see in my head...

721
00:55:19,562 --> 00:55:21,689
is probably not in the least bit
like a cougar.

722
00:55:21,764 --> 00:55:23,925
It's more like a donkey or a goat.

723
00:55:24,033 --> 00:55:26,797
You know, sometimes I'm not
so sure I really saw him.

724
00:55:26,902 --> 00:55:29,700
Maybe he's just
something I dreamed up.

725
00:55:32,975 --> 00:55:34,306
You okay?

726
00:55:36,646 --> 00:55:38,807
You don't say much, do you?

727
00:55:39,248 --> 00:55:40,909
No, I guess not.

728
00:55:43,886 --> 00:55:48,482
Let's talk about something
and get it out of the way, okay?

729
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:00,598
I can hear that you've had...

730
00:56:01,637 --> 00:56:04,071
some kind of soft palate repair.

731
00:56:05,174 --> 00:56:08,803
But I understand you fine
because you speak very well.

732
00:56:09,812 --> 00:56:12,940
If you don't want to talk to me,
that's cool.

733
00:56:14,016 --> 00:56:16,644
But I hope that you will, because...

734
00:56:17,987 --> 00:56:20,012
I know what it's like
to have people...

735
00:56:20,122 --> 00:56:22,750
always thinking that you're different.

736
00:56:26,362 --> 00:56:27,829
That's good.

737
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,700
May I touch your face?

738
00:56:34,003 --> 00:56:36,995
I want to know
if you're smiling or frowning.

739
00:56:37,106 --> 00:56:40,542
I want to know whether I should
just shut up or not.

740
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,452
Take my word that I'm smiling.

741
00:56:57,626 --> 00:56:59,116
I have to go.

742
00:56:59,228 --> 00:57:01,355
If I offended you, I didn't mean to.

743
00:57:01,664 --> 00:57:02,631
No.

744
00:57:10,005 --> 00:57:12,132
F.B.I. Headquarters,
Washington, D.C.

745
00:57:12,208 --> 00:57:14,108
WILL: I don't know
what they were like.

746
00:57:14,176 --> 00:57:16,838
It'd help if I could see
some of their personal effects.

747
00:57:16,912 --> 00:57:19,710
Diaries, letters.
Do you have those things?

748
00:57:19,815 --> 00:57:21,874
I sure do. I mean, other than...

749
00:57:21,984 --> 00:57:24,544
one or two little keepsakes
Niles Jacobi got.

750
00:57:26,021 --> 00:57:29,218
That would be Mr. Jacobi's
surviving son by his first wife?

751
00:57:29,325 --> 00:57:32,658
Yes. As their executor, I keep
all that stuff in the office...

752
00:57:32,728 --> 00:57:36,687
along with some of the smaller
valuables, till after probate.

753
00:57:36,832 --> 00:57:39,665
But the Birmingham P.D.'s
been all through it.

754
00:57:39,735 --> 00:57:42,329
Could you pack those things
and ship them up to me?

755
00:57:46,408 --> 00:57:49,536
I hate to ask.
I know it's a pain in the ass.

756
00:57:52,047 --> 00:57:53,275
Hell...

757
00:57:54,083 --> 00:57:57,211
probate judge is
an old golfing buddy of mine.

758
00:57:58,621 --> 00:58:03,285
Son, just tell me you're
gonna nail that son of a bitch.

759
00:58:03,459 --> 00:58:04,759
We're doing our best.

760
00:58:05,928 --> 00:58:08,055
Hey, thanks, Mr. Metcalf.

761
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:11,122
A note hidden in Lecter's cell.
Sounds like a fan letter.

762
00:58:11,233 --> 00:58:12,928
Might've been mailed
by the Tooth Fairy.

763
00:58:13,035 --> 00:58:14,559
He wants Lecter's approval.

764
00:58:14,637 --> 00:58:16,935
He's curious about you.
He's asking questions.

765
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:18,768
I've scrambled a chopper.

766
00:58:18,874 --> 00:58:20,205
Does Lecter know we have the note?

767
00:58:20,276 --> 00:58:22,642
CRAWFORD: Not yet. It was found in
a routine cleanup.

768
00:58:22,745 --> 00:58:24,144
WILL: They don't open his mail?

769
00:58:24,246 --> 00:58:25,907
CRAWFORD: Need a warrant.
X-rays only.

770
00:58:25,981 --> 00:58:28,108
WILL: Where's Lecter?
CRAWFORD: The holding cage.

771
00:58:28,217 --> 00:58:29,650
WILL: Can he see his cell?

772
00:58:29,752 --> 00:58:32,243
CRAWFORD: No. But he's been there
almost half an hour.

773
00:58:32,321 --> 00:58:33,948
He'll soon start to wonder
what's wrong.

774
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:36,115
We got to buy time, Jack.

775
00:58:39,228 --> 00:58:40,661
CRAWFORD: Dr. Chilton.
CHILTON: Yes?

776
00:58:40,763 --> 00:58:42,390
Call your building superintendent...

777
00:58:42,464 --> 00:58:43,954
or engineer, whoever's in charge.

778
00:58:44,066 --> 00:58:46,899
Tell him to pull the circuit
breakers on Lecter's hall.

779
00:58:46,969 --> 00:58:49,995
Have the super walk down
the hall past the cell...

780
00:58:50,105 --> 00:58:51,094
carrying tools.

781
00:58:51,173 --> 00:58:55,576
He'll be in a hurry, pissed off,
too busy to answer questions.

782
00:58:55,644 --> 00:58:58,841
And don't forget:
Don't touch the note, okay?

783
00:58:59,415 --> 00:59:01,246
Graham's on his way.

784
00:59:01,584 --> 00:59:05,281
Listen up! We've got a note
coming in on the fly...

785
00:59:05,387 --> 00:59:09,414
possibly from the Tooth Fairy.
Number One Priority.

786
00:59:09,892 --> 00:59:12,417
It has to go back to
Lecter's cell within the hour...

787
00:59:12,494 --> 00:59:13,825
unmarked.

788
00:59:14,163 --> 00:59:18,463
We'll need Hair and Fiber,

DOLARHYDE [Voice-over]: My dear Dr. Lecter.:
I wanted to tell you...

792
00:59:28,811 --> 00:59:29,800
I'm delighted...

793
00:59:29,879 --> 00:59:31,938
that you've taken an interest in me.

And when I learned of your vast

"Dare I?" Of course I do.

you'll tell them who I am.

Besides, what particular body
I currently occupy is trivial.

01:08:30,619 --> 01:08:32,553
He had a fake Bureau ID...

946
01:08:32,654 --> 01:08:35,646
and was trying to get
the Leeds family autopsy photos.

947
01:08:36,558 --> 01:08:40,153
It's a Federal beef, so Atlanta
kicked him back to us.

948
01:08:40,395 --> 01:08:41,555
Personally...

949
01:08:41,663 --> 01:08:44,154
I'd like nothing better
than to see the dirt sandwich...

950

pulling five at Leavenworth.

951
01:08:46,134 --> 01:08:49,103
But maybe there's a better way
to handle this.

952
01:08:49,171 --> 01:08:50,763
Yeah? What's that?

953
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:52,830
I think we ought to give him a story.

954
01:08:53,308 --> 01:08:54,673
WILL: The Tooth Fairy's ugly...

955
01:08:54,776 --> 01:08:58,041
and he's impotent with members
of the opposite sex.

956
01:08:58,814 --> 01:09:02,614
Also, he sexually molests
his male victims.

957
01:09:03,051 --> 01:09:04,484
While they're alive?

958
01:09:04,553 --> 01:09:07,181
WILL: Sorry, I can't go into
those details.

959
01:09:07,289 --> 01:09:09,018
But we do also speculate...

960
01:09:09,124 --> 01:09:11,684
that he's the product
of an incestuous home.

961
01:09:11,993 --> 01:09:14,553
No wonder the creep's
such a loser, right?

962
01:09:16,798 --> 01:09:19,460
That's a tip we got
from Dr. Lecter, by the way.

963
01:09:19,534 --> 01:09:22,901
So it's true that Lecter's
helping with your investigation?

964
01:09:23,672 --> 01:09:25,469
WILL: Yes, it's true.

966

himself in the same league.

so I can work on it at night.

Get down!

You okay?

JOSH: Mom?

MOLLY: Will?

1579
01:57:26,385 --> 01:57:28,182
Where are you guys?

1580
01:57:30,189 --> 01:57:32,123
I thought I heard some kind of....

1581
01:57:34,126 --> 01:57:35,286
Will?

1582
01:57:36,195 --> 01:57:37,856
Molly, get down!

What?

1588
01:58:10,095 --> 01:58:11,995
Shoot him. Shoot him.

LECTER [Voice-over]: My dear Will.:
You must be healed by now.

1593
01:58:47,666 --> 01:58:49,759
On the outside, at least.

1594
01:58:49,868 --> 01:58:52,098
I hope you're not too ugly.

1595
01:58:52,204 --> 01:58:54,832
What a collection of scars you have!

1596
01:58:54,973 --> 01:58:57,203
Never forget
who gave you the best of them.

1597
01:58:57,309 --> 01:58:58,708
And be grateful.

1598

Our scars have the power
to remind us the past was real.

We live in a primitive time,
don't we, Will?

1600
01:59:06,185 --> 01:59:08,312
Neither savage nor wise.

1601

Half measures are the curse of it.

A rational society would either
kill me or put me to some use.

Do you dream much, Will?
I think of you often.

CHILTON: Hannibal?
There's someone here to see you.

1607
01:59:45,557 --> 01:59:48,890
Wants to ask a few questions.
I said you'd probably refuse.

1608
01:59:50,329 --> 01:59:53,594
A young woman.
Says she's from the FBI.

1609
01:59:53,699 --> 01:59:56,691
Though she's far too pretty,
if you ask me.

1610
01:59:58,003 --> 02:00:00,164
I'll tell her you said no.
